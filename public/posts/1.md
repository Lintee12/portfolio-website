# Portfolio Website

I had to make a portfolio for an assignment at NBCC, so i decided why not make a website?

## Technologies I used

### Remix

[Remix](https://remix.run/) is a full stack Web Development Framework that is quickly gaining popularity, it allows you to integrate Server Side code seamlessly with frontend code. It uses React.js for frontend and express.js for the backend.

Remix is known for its fast speeds and simplicty, making it a strong alternative over other full stack frameworks like Next.js.

### Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is Cloud hosting platoform that allows users to host node.js projects, Vercel runs on [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) which is a cloud [Serverless Function](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/serverless-functions.html) model that allows cloud computations to scale dynamically so you only have to pay for what you use.

Vercel offers an extremley generous free tier that allows you to host your project absolutley free as long as you dont go over the specified usage limits.
